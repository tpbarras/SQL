# For this project, I had downloaded an excel spreadsheet containing the top artists of 2015 and created a table.

# From here I inserted the csv file into the table, allowing me to explore the data.

# First, I wanted to find which tracks had the highest popularity and narrowed down to the top 5. 
  SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
    FROM BIT_DB.SpotifyData
    GROUP BY track_name
    ORDER BY popularity desc 
    limit 5 ;
    
# Then, I wanted to see the average of danceability and energy in these top songs to potentially see any influence 
# Found that the averages were not too high and showed me that a good portion are relatively danceable and energetic with some being on the lower side. 

  SELECT avg(danceability), 
  avg(energy)

# I then got curious and wanted to see what the energy and speechiness of the tracks looked like as well. 
# From there it didn't look like there was much of a correlation between speechiness and energy contributing to the popularity of the songs. So I quickly disregarded it.
